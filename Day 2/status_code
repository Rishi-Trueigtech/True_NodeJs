**🤔What is a Status Code in Node.js?**
➡️A status code in Node.js (or any web server) is a 3-digit number that tells the client (browser, Postman, etc.) about the result of a request.

**🤔How Status Codes Work in Node.js**

➡️When the server processes a request, it sends a response with a status code.
➡️The status code tells the client whether the request was successful, failed, or needs action.

#Common HTTP Status Codes in Node.js
##Success Codes (2xx) → Request was successful.

➡️200 OK → Everything is fine!
➡️201 Created → A new resource was created (used for POST requests).

##Redirection Codes (3xx) → Request needs to be redirected.

➡️301 Moved Permanently → URL has changed.
➡️302 Found → Temporary redirection.

##Client Errors (4xx) → Problem from the client's side.

➡️400 Bad Request → The request was incorrect.
➡️401 Unauthorized → Authentication is needed.
➡️403 Forbidden → Client does not have permission.
➡️404 Not Found → Requested page does not exist.

##Server Errors (5xx) → Problem on the server.

➡️500 Internal Server Error → Something broke on the server.
➡️503 Service Unavailable → Server is overloaded or under maintenance.
