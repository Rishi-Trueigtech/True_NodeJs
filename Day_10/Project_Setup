Project Setup and Structure in Express.js
A well-structured Express.js project ensures maintainability, scalability, and security.
Here’s how you can organize your project effectively.

1. Project Organization
   A clean folder structure helps in managing the project efficiently. A typical structure looks like this:

/project-root
│── /controllers # Route handlers (controllers)
│── /models # Database models (Mongoose, Sequelize, etc.)
│── /routes # Route definitions
│── /middlewares # Custom middlewares (auth, logging, etc.)
│── /utils # Utility functions (email, error handling, etc.)
│── /config # Configuration files (DB, environment settings)
│── /public # Static files (CSS, JS, images)
│── /views # Template engine views (if using Pug, EJS)
│── .env # Environment variables
│── server.js # Entry point
│── package.json # Dependencies and scripts
│── README.md # Project documentation

2. MVC Architecture
   The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern helps in separating concerns:

Model (M) → Defines database schema and interactions (MongoDB, Sequelize).
View (V) → Handles the frontend or template rendering (Pug, EJS).
Controller (C) → Handles business logic and processes requests.
